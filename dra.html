<h1>DRAINAGE DIVIDES</h1>
<img src="Euro.png">--^<p><b></b>Major drainage divides (red ridgelines) and <a href="drain.html">drainage basins</a> (green regions) in Europe. (Note the German labels.)</p>
<p>A drainage divide, water divide, divide, ridgeline, watershed, or water parting is the line that separates neighbouring drainage basins. On rugged land,
 the divide lies along topographical ridges, and may be in the form of a single range of hills or mountains, known as a dividing range. On flat terrain,
 especially where the ground is marshy, the divide may be harder to discern.</p>

<p>A valley floor divide is a low drainage divide that runs across a valley, sometimes created by deposition or stream capture.</p>

<p>Since ridgelines are relatively easy to see and agree about, drainage divides are often natural borders defining political boundaries, as with the 18th 
century North America Royal Proclamation of 1763 that preceded the American Revolution.</p>
