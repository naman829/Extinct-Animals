<p>Lenapehoking is a term for the lands historically inhabited by the Native American people known as the Lenape (named the Delaware people or Delaware
 Nation by early European settlers) in what is now the Mid-Atlantic United States. Though it is sometimes said to be a word in the Delaware languages for 
this area, like much of the toponymy involving languages in the Algonquian linguistic group, there is some confusion about the meaning and history of the 
name. Much of this land is now heavily urbanized and suburbanized. Although the Delaware generally proved to be good neighbors to the colonies of New Sweden
 and New Netherlands, by the early 18th century, English settlers had depopulated or ruthlessly displaced most surviving tribal peoples.</p>
<p>There is no universal agreement among scholars regarding the autonym of Lenape territory. Some believe the area the Lenape inhabited was called
 'Scheyichbi,' or "the place bordering the ocean". According to some people, the Lenape called this territory "Lenapehoking" 
 meaning in the land of the Lenape'. This assertion has gained widespread acceptance and is found widely in recent literature on the Lenape, including in the
 websites of purported Lenape people.</p>
<p>At the time of the arrival of the Europeans in the 16th and 17th centuries, the Lenape homeland ranged along the Atlantic's coast from western Connecticut
 to Delaware, which generally encompassed the territory adjacent to the Delaware and lower Hudson river valleys, as well the hill-and-ridge dominated 
territory between them. Relatives of the Algonquian Amerindians whose territories ranged along the entire coast from beyond the Saint Lawrence River in
 today's Canada, and the tribes throughout all of New England, down into northern South Carolina, the Delaware Confederation stretched from the
 southern shores of modern-day Delaware along the Atlantic seaboard into western Long Island and Connecticut, then extended westwards across the Hudson 
water gap into the eastern Catskills part of the Appalachians range around the headwaters of the Delaware River and along both banks of its basin down to the
 mouth of the Lehigh.</p>

<p>Inland, the tribe had to deal with the fierce and territorial Susquehannocks; the Delawares' territory has generally been plotted with boundaries along 
mountain ridges topped by the drainage divides between the right bank tributaries of the Delaware River on the east—and on the west and south—the left bank
 tributaries of the Susquehanna and Lehigh Rivers; bounds which included the Catskills, northern parts of eastern Pennsylvania down through the entire 
Poconos along the left bank Lehigh River. The Schuylkill River and its mouth (future Philadelphia area counties) or right bank Lehigh was contested hunting 
grounds, generally shared with the Susquehannock and the occasional visit by a related Potomac tribe when there wasn't active tribal warfare. The greater 
Philadelphia area was known to host European to Indian contacts from the Dutch traders contacts with the Susquehanna (1600), English traders (1602), and
 both tribes with New Netherlands traders after 1610</p>

<p>Along the left bank Delaware valley, the territory extended to all of present-day New Jersey, and the southern counties of New York State, including 
Rockland, Orange, Westchester, and Putnam Counties, Nassau County, and the five boroughs of New York City.</p>

<p>today, some Native Americans, but not limited to the Lenape (Delaware) tribes, live in the Northeast Corridor or Eastern Seaboard. Many of them first 
arrived in the 1920s to 1960s from the Iroquois Confederacy employed as skyscraper construction workers, where they were nicknamed "Mohawks" and played an
 important role in building the skyline of Philadelphia and New York City. In the University City section of West Philadelphia, there has been some
 political activity by Urban Indian residents of the area, who adapted the namesake Lenapehoking to where they live.</p>
