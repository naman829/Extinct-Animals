<h1>WALLACE CRAIG</h1>
<p>Wallace Craig (1876–1954) was an American experimental psychologist and behavior scientist. He provided a conceptual framework for the study of behavior
 organization and is regarded as one of the founders of ethology. Craig experimentally studied the behavioral expression of emotion, the way innate and
 learned behavioral tendencies are integrated, and how vocal as well as social behaviors are organized. He encouraged a view of behavior as an integrated 
process with evolutionary, motivational, experiential, social and ecological degrees of freedom. This integrative perspective helped shape modern behavioral
 science.</p>
