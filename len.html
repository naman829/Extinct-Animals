<p>The Lenape  also called the Leni Lenape, Lenni Lenape and Delaware people, are an indigenous people of the Northeastern Woodlands, who live in Canada
 and the United States. Their historical territory included present-day New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania along the Delaware River watershed, New York 
City, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson Valley.[notes 1] Today, Lenape people belong to the Delaware Nation and Delaware Tribe of Indians in Oklahoma
; the Stockbridge-Munsee Community in Wisconsin; and the Munsee-Delaware Nation, Moravian of the Thames First Nation, and Delaware of Six Nations in Ontario.</p>

<p>The Lenape have a matrilineal clan system and historically were matrilocal.</p>

<p>During the decades of the 18th century, most Lenape were pushed out of their homeland by expanding European colonies. Their dire situation was exacerbated
 by losses from intertribal conflicts. The divisions and troubles of the American Revolutionary War and United States' independence pushed them farther west.
 In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the eastern United States to the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma and 
surrounding territory) under the Indian removal policy. In the 21st century, most Lenape now reside in Oklahoma, with some communities living also in
 Wisconsin and Ontario.</p>
