<h1><b><i>BEAUTIFUL EXTINCT ANIMALS</i></b></p></h1>
<p>question-why do animals become extinct?...._________________answer-In the distant past, several species of animals became extinct through natural causes. ... But ever since human beings 
have been on Earth, and especially in the last hundred years, animal species have become extinct because of hunting, pollution,
or the destruction of the places where they live.</p>
<p>In biology, extinction is the termination of an organism or of a group of organisms,
 normally a species. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of the species,
 although the capacity to breed and recover may have been lost before this point.
