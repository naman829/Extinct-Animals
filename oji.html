<p>The Ojibwe, Ojibwa, Chippewa, or Saulteaux are an Anishinaabeg group of Indigenous Peoples in North America, which is referred to by many of its 
Indigenous peoples as Turtle Island.[dubious – discuss] They live in Canada and the United States and are one of the largest Indigenous ethnic groups north
 of the Rio Grande. In Canada, they are the second-largest First Nations population, surpassed only by the Cree. In the United States, they have the 
fifth-largest population among Native American tribes, surpassed in number only by the Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw and Lakota-Dakota-Nakota people.</p>

<p>The Ojibwe people traditionally have spoken the Ojibwe language, a branch of the Algonquian language family. They are part of the Council of Three Fires 
and the Anishinaabeg, which include the Algonquin, Nipissing, Oji-Cree, Odawa and the Potawatomi. They also through the Saulteaux branch were a part of the 
Iron Confederacy joining the Cree, Assiniboine and, Metis.</p>

<p>The majority of the Ojibwe people live in Canada. There are 77,940 mainline Ojibwe; 76,760 Saulteaux and 8,770 Mississaugas, organized in 125 bands, and 
living from western Quebec to eastern British Columbia. As of 2010, Ojibwe in the US census population is 170,742.</p>

<p>Ojibwe are known for their birch bark canoes, birch bark scrolls, mining and trade in copper, and cultivation of wild rice and, Maple syrup. Their
 Midewiwin Society is well respected as the keeper of detailed and complex scrolls of events, oral history, songs, maps, memories, stories, geometry, and
 mathematics. It is theorized that the Ojibwa created the Dreamcatcher, although it gained more recognition in the Pan-Indianism
 movement of the 1970s.</p>

<p>The Ojibwe people set the agenda with European-Canadian leaders by signing detailed treaties before they allowed many European settlers into their 
western areas.</p>
