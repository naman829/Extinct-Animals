<h1>TAXONOMY OF PASSENGER PIGEON</h1>

<p>Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus coined the binomial name Columba macroura for both the mourning dove and the passenger pigeon in the 1758 edition 
of his work Systema Naturae (the starting point of biological nomenclature), wherein he appears to have considered the two identical. 
This composite description cited accounts of these birds in two pre-Linnean books. One of these was Mark Catesby's description of the passenger pigeon,
 which was published in his 1731 to 1743 work Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands, which referred to this bird as
 Palumbus migratorius, and was accompanied by the earliest published illustration of the species. Catesby's description
 was combined with the 1743 description of the mourning dove by George Edwards, who used the name C. macroura for that bird. There is nothing to suggest 
Linnaeus ever saw specimens of these birds himself, and his description is thought to be fully derivative of these earlier accounts and their illustrations.
 In his 1766 edition of Systema Naturae, Linnaeus dropped the name C. macroura, and instead used the name C. migratoria for the passenger pigeon,
 and C. carolinensis for the mourning dove. In the same edition, Linnaeus also named C. canadensis, based on Turtur canadensis, as used by Mathurin Jacques 
Brisson in 1760. Brisson's description was later shown to have been based on a female passenger pigeon.</p>

<p>In 1827 William John Swainson moved the passenger pigeon from the genus Columba to the new monotypic genus Ectopistes, due in part to the length of the
 wings and the wedge shape of the tail.In 1906 Outram Bangs suggested that because Linnaeus had wholly copied Catesby's text when coining C. macroura, 
this name should apply to the passenger pigeon, as E. macroura.In 1918 Harry C. Oberholser suggested that C. canadensis should take precedence
 over C. migratoria (as E. canadensis), as it appeared on an earlier page in Linnaeus' book. In 1952 Francis Hemming proposed that the International
 Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) secure the specific name macroura for the mourning dove, and the name migratorius for the passenger pigeon,
 since this was the intended use by the authors on whose work Linnaeus had based his description. This was accepted by the ICZN, 
which used its plenary powers to designate the species for the respective names in 1955.</p>
